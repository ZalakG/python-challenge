In this challenge under Module-3_challenge folder, I have created two folders named PyBank and PyPoll. In each PyBank and PyPoll folders there are
1) Analysis folder
2) Resources folder
3) main.py script file (for PyBank folder--> PyBank_main.Py & for PyPoll folder--> PyPoll_main.py) 

(1) Analysis folder in each PyBank & PyPoll contains a text file which is the output/result of the written code.

	PyBank Analysis folder contains fin_analysis.txt file which is the output of PyBank_main.Py file
	PyPoll Analysis folder contains election_result.txt which is the analysis/output of PyPoll_main.py file

(2) Resources foldersfor each PyBank and PyPoll folders contains CSV files

	For PyBank, Resources folder contains budget_data.csv
